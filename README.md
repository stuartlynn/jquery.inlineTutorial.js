jquery.inlineTutorial.js is a jquery ui plugin to allow quick and easy inline tutorials for sites to be created. You can see it in action at whales.zooniverse.org

its setup with

("#containerElement").inlineTutorial(); 

It takes an array of steps as an argument :
("#containerElement").inlineTutorial({steps : [] } );

the plugin then runs through each step in turn. A step looks like this : 

  {
         title: "A title",
         text: "Blah balh this is stuff blah blah ",
         location: [640,90],
         onLeave: function(){ },
         triggers: [{elements : "#someOtherElement", action: "click"}],
         disableControls: true,
         prompt: "Do something",
         speed:200,
         indicatorPos: "left top"
  }

and can have the following properties :

title : the title of the step
text : the main text of the step

triggers : a has of elements and actions that can also trigger moving to the next step 
disableControls : disable manually moving to the next step â€¦ so in this case the user has to click the main sound button to move on
